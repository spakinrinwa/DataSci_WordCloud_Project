## What is a WordCloud?
We have to deal with a lot of textual data everyday. For example, this readme document contains textual data. In extracting keywords in text and to visually illustrate the level of importance of the keywords in a text document, the WordCloud is used. As human beings, we naturally prefer visual or graphical data. WordCloud is a means to find out the most important words or terms when characterizing or classifying a text.
